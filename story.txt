Sam the raccoon lives in Wisconsin.
He loves to ramen and pizza.
One night he looks up to the sky and notices something strange...
<<<<<<< HEAD
A long stairs appears from the sky,and Sam goes up because of curiousity.
He was too happy to get dizzy after he gets to the top.It is a resturant 
above the sky, and there is a big size of pizza there,and he can't control
and eat it all by himself. 
=======

The moon was in the sky as usual, but it looked like it was a big pizza.
Sam was very happy at this fact because he loves pizza. Sam wanted to get a 
bite of the lunar pizza.
