Sam the raccoon lives in Wisconsin.
He loves to ramen and pizza.
One night he looks up to the sky and notices something strange...

The moon was in the sky as usual, but it looked like it was a big pizza.
Sam was very happy at this fact because he loves pizza. Sam wanted to get a 
bite of the lunar pizza.
